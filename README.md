## Tic-tac-toe rules

  Number of Players: 2

Each player must choose 1 out of the 9 possible spaces to play in. The place she or he has chosen will be marked by their symbol: X (for player 1) and O (for player 2). 

You can‚Äôt play on any position more than  once.

The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, wins the game. Keep in mind these rows can be 

    ‚Ä¢ horizontal (left-to-right or right-to-left)
      
    ‚Ä¢ vertical (from up to down or down to up)
      
    ‚Ä¢ or diagonal (e.g. top-left to bottom-right).
